### Hi there, I am Ludovico. ðŸ‘‹

I am currently carrying out my master degree thesis in computer vision at Volvo cars in GÃ¶theborg, Sweden.
In the past, I have been a Machine learning engineer intern for ClearBox.ai, working on adversarial attacks against computer vision models. I have also collaborated with the Alan Turing Institute, working on epidemiological modelling in Julia and multiobjective optimization algorithms with a focus on fairness.  
I am also the lead developer of Surrogates.jl, a library that focuses on approximating differential equations with novel meta-models techniques. You can also take (automatic) derivatives of those models, how cool!
