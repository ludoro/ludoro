### Hi there, I am Ludovico. ðŸ‘‹

I am currently collaborating with the Alan Turing Institute, working on epidemiological modelling in Julia and multi objective optimization algorithms with a focus on fairness issues. 
In the past, I have been a Machine learning engineer intern for ClearBox.ai, working on adversarial attacks against computer vision models. 
I am also the lead developer of Surrogates.jl, a library that focuses on approximating differential equations with novel meta-models techniques. You can also take (automatic) derivatives of those models, how cool! 
Reach me at ludovicobessi@gmail.com if you want to know more :D
